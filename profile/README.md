Check here later - We're working on our 2D game engine, a fork of Maddy Thorson's Monocle, and will post it under the MIT License!

Starlight will support Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and more.

We plan to use this for commercial games in the future.

(Here's hoping we can get it ready by Ludum Dare 53/54!)
