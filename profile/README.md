Check here later - We're working on our 2D engine setup, a version of Maddy Thorson's Monocle (Used in Celeste and Towerfall), and will post it under the MIT License!

It will support Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and more.

We plan to use this for commercial games in the future.

(Here's hoping we can get it ready by Ludum Dare 54!)
